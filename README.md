This is an Android applications with intention to share information about museum and take the user to experience the museum itself.
With Covid-19 cases rising, it becomes difficult for us to go to crowded places, such as museum. By using this application, I hoped that you can enjoy, and know the atmosphere of your favorite museum...
which is a joke...
okay, the concept is real, but it's a dummy application so please don't say anything about this... or the code since I just started learning Android Studio and Kotlin 3 days before I wrote this text.
